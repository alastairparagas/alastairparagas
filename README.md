Hi, I'm Alastair Paragas! I currently work as an engineer at Apple's Machine Learning Platform and Technology team, under [Apple ML/AI](https://www.apple.com/jobs/us/teams/machine-learning-and-ai.html) in Seattle. I am also a part-time MSCS grad student at Georgia Tech specializing in Machine Learning graduating Fall 2020. You can also visit me at my personal website, [aparagas.com](https://aparagas.com/)!

For some of my past work and internship experiences, catch me around the 'net at:
  * European Organization for Nuclear Research (2017), Geneva, Switzerland - https://cds.cern.ch/record/2280009 - a keyword recommendation and anomaly-detection engine for Zenodo (CERN's public research paper repository)
  * Wolfram Summer School Alumni (2015), Waltham, MA - https://education.wolfram.com/summer/school/alumni/2015/, where I got to build a block-based programming environment, much like Scratch, powered by the Wolfram Language and environment - extra cool that we got mentored by Stephen Wolfram himself!
  * FIU Honors College, Miami, FL - where I got to build the first course registration system during freshman year(Honors CRS) and the [MyHonors student portal](https://myhonors.fiu.edu/#/login/)!

I mantain some of my [grad school notes here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1L7JyA4RilWfflftdziEMGJXT6njG7W6O), and hoping to finish cataloguing these in due time, with courses ranging from:
  * CS7641 - Machine Learning -  aimed to be a whirlwind tour on all topics related to the field of Machine Learning, which covers all classes of algorithms that perform "better" over time either through training or experience.
  * CS7624 - Reinforcement Learning - a course solely focused on Reinforcement Learning, a sub-area of Machine Learning focused on classes of algorithms that modify and improve their performance based on experience.
  * ISYE 6644 - Simulation - a grad-level Statistics course focusing on Simulation - the most powerful and flexible way of solving problems mathematically besides usual analytical and numerical methods as learned in previous Math courses. Focuses on the statistical theory behind generating random variates drawn from various probability distributions, input and output analysis,  Brownian Motion and many more, serving as a quite good review of Calc 1-3 and Differential Equations
  * CS7638 - High Performance Computer Architecture - covers modern computer architecture, including branch prediction, out-of-order instruction execution, cache optimizations, multi-level caches, memory and storage, cache coherence and consistency, and multi- and many-core processors
  * ... and many more!

Feel free to browse through my GitHub repositories - featuring some personal projects and [hackathon projects](https://devpost.com/alastairparagas) (mostly) from my time in undergrad - where we spent hours driving/flying across the country, nights without sleep and memories to share. Some cool stuff to call out were: 
  * [Nightwatch](https://github.com/NightWatchApp) - an IoT wearable that will statistically analyze and alert for Seizures, Sleep Paralysis, Sleep Apnea, Narcolepsy and Brigada
  * [MetroBoom](https://devpost.com/software/metroboom) - a peer-to-peer jukebox to solve an issue of my friends having to deal with my strange music (and audio recordings) while spending hours driving from South Florida to various hackathons
  * [Tidbit](https://devpost.com/software/tidbit) - a Chrome extension that summarizes web content using NLP, with a cool Haskell backend!
  * [Halcyon](https://devpost.com/software/halcyon) - a web browser for visually impaired people, complete with capabilities for human operator assistance, web summarization and voice/utterance based navigation
  * [Ellery](https://devpost.com/software/ellery) - our very own advising and course planning student portal wrapping over MyFIU, using predictive stats to calculate best options to take in terms of courses and grades!
  * [Cambio](https://github.com/heycuba-cambio/cambio-frontend) - a Markdown-based encrypted over SMTP/POP3 web browser
